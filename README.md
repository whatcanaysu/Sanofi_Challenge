# Sanofi Challenge :rocket:
Welcome to the Sanofi Challenge repository! :wave:

Overview
In this challenge, I have constructed models related to manufacturing yield that can help Sanofi process engineers answer their questions. The goal was to build a model for 96 different production units and extract test features from QC_Data for both input and output. After analyzing the data, I identified weighted attributes and explored various models. And guess what? XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model! :tada:

Repository Structure
1. 'data/': This directory contains the data files used in the challenge.
2. 'notebooks/': This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
3. 'README.md': You're reading it right now! :smiley:

## Getting Started
To get started with the Sanofi Challenge, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
python
git clone https://github.com/whatcanaysu/Sanofi_Challenge.git
```
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Explore the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to see the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Check out the model/ directory to find the evaluation metrics and model performance.

Model Highlights
The XGBoost model showcased remarkable performance in predicting manufacturing yield. By leveraging the insights gained from the model, I was able to identify the parameters that have the most impact on the yield_value. This information can provide valuable insights to Sanofi process engineers, enabling them to optimize production processes and improve yields. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
